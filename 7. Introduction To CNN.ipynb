    "### Convolution\n",
    "Usually, you will not feed the entire image to a CNN. You will feed the features that are most important in classifying the image. The features are obtained through a process known as convolution. The convolution operation results in what is known as a feature map. It is also referred to as the convolved feature or an activation map.  The feature map is obtained by applying a feature detector to the input image. The feature detector is also referred to as a kernel or a filter. The filter is usually a 3 by 3 matrix. However, other types of matrices can be used. The feature map is obtained through an element-wise multiplication of the filter with the matrix representation of the input image. The objective here is to reduce the size of the image being passed to the CNN while maintaining the important features. The filter slides step by step through each of the elements in the input image. These steps are known as strides and can be defined when creating the CNN. When building the CNN you will be able to define the number of filters you want for your network. "

This is what is known as spatial invariance. There are several types of pooling, for example, max-pooling average pooling, and min pooling. For instance, in max-pooling a 2 by 2 matrix is slid over the feature map while picking the largest value in a given box. "

    "With most algorithms that handle image processing, the filters are typically created by an engineer based on heuristics. CNNs can learn what characteristics in the filters are the most important. That saves a lot of time and trial and error work since we don't need as many parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't seem like a huge savings until you are working with high resolution images that have thousands of pixels. The convolutional neural network algorithm's main purpose is to get data into forms that are easier to process without losing the features that are important for figuring out what the data represents. This also makes them great candidates for handling huge datasets.\n",

    "CNNs work by applying filters to your input data. What makes them so special is that CNNs are able to tune the filters as training happens. That way the results are fine-tuned in real time, even when you have huge data sets, like with images.\n",

    "Since the filters can be updated to train the CNN better, this removes the need for hand-created filters. That gives us more flexibility in the number of filters we can apply to a data set and the relevance of those filters. Using this algorithm, we can work on more sophisticated problems like face recognition.\n",
