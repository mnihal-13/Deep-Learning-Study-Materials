    "<b> Neural networks</b>, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.<br>\n",
    "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network."

    "Once an input layer is determined, weights are assigned. These weights help determine the importance of any given variable, with larger onces contributing more significantly to the output compared to other inputs. All inputs are then multiplied by their respective weights and then summed. Afterward, the output is passed through an activation function, which determines the output. If that output exceeds a given threshold, It \"fires\" (or activates) the node, passing data to the next layer in the network. This results in the output of one node becoming the input of the next node. This process of passing data from one layer to the next layer defines this neural network as feedforward network."

The decision to go or not to go is our predicted outcome, or y-hat. Let's assume that there are three factors influencing your decision-making:\n",
    "1. Are the waves good? (Yes:1, No:0)\n",
    "2. Is the line-up empty? (Yes:1, No:0)\n",
    "3. Has there been a recent shark attack? (Yes:0, No:1)\n",

    "- X1 = 1, since the waves are pumping\n",
    "- X2 = 0, since the crowds are out\n",
    "- X3 = 1, since there hasn't been a recent shark attack\n",

When we observe one decison, like in the above example, we can see how a neural network could make increasinly complex decisions depending on the output of previous decisions or layers.\n",

Since neural networks behave similarly to decision trees, cascading data from one node to another, having x values between 0 and 1 will reduce the impact of any given change of a single variable on the output of any given node, and subsequently, the output of the neural network.\n",

The process in which the algorithm adjusts its weights is through gradient descent, allowing the model to determine the direction to take to reduce errors (or minimise the cost function).
